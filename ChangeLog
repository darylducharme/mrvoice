Tue  Aug 12 2002	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)

       the Windows builds.
     * Added code to check for a file named "default.mrv" in the hotkey
       save directory.  If that exists, load up those hotkeys when

       decrement when an MP3 is unavailable/unreadable.

       of these days Holly will draw me one that looks better.

Tue  Feb  5 2002	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)

     * Using Win32::Process to start/stop the MP3 player on Windows.  A much

       did not exist on the disk.
     * Added Escape as a hotkey to stop the currently-playing MP3
     * Added ability to clear selected hotkeys, instead of having to clear
       all hotkeys.
     * Added F11 and F12 as usable hotkeys.  NOTE: F11 and F12 cause
       problems under WindowMaker by default.
     * Added more status notes for status line.
     * Disabled the ability to resize the main box, until I figure out how
       to get things to resize nicely.
