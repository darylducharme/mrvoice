Sat  Sep 18  2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)

     * Wrap the database SQL import in a transaction for efficency.
     * Replace spurious die() calls with status updates.
     * Add a tool, cpancheck.pl, to check CPAN for updates of the modules
       that Mr. Voice uses.

Fri  Sep 17  2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Get the move_tank function working with the HList.  Thanks to 
       Kyle at sickduck.org for the help.
     * Move the CWX-specific functions to their own branch.
     * Use a white background for the "Invalid" songs, too.
     * Apply the red color style to invalid songs in the holding tank, too.

Mon  Sep 13  2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Make nice white backgrounds by default for listboxes and entry 
       widgets.

Sun  Sep 12  2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Add a Publisher choice to the bulk_add routine.
     * Refactor a couple of looped database queries to use placeholders.
     * Use the same color for the Preview Song button (add new song window)
       as we do for the Play button.
     * Switch to a Tk::HList for the mainbox and the holding tank.

Sat  Sep 11  2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Fixed a similar bug in the edit_categories function.
     * Fixed an inaccuracy in progress reporting with update_times, due
       to the previous policy of ignoring invalid files.
     * Provide a sane -initialdir to getOpenFile, getSaveFile, and
       chooseDirectory, if none is set.
     * Remove obsolete code to upgrade to 1.7 (song times in database) and
       1.10 (publisher) table schemas.  If they haven't done it by now,
       this is handled by the upgrade_20.pl utility.
     * Work around breakage in bulk_add if the directory has spaces in it.
     * Format the information in the Advanced Date Search a little nicer.
     * Better window titles for Load/Save dialogs.

Fri  Sep 10  2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Fixed a bug in the delete_categories function that was causing
       an extra space to get added to the category code.
     * Refactor the get_rows subroutine to be cleaner.

Thu  Sep 9  2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Move the default setup stuff (formerly in quicksetup.pl) into the
       main program, since we don't have to deal with the complexity of
       MySQL anymore.

Wed  Sep 8  2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Work around the lack of $dbh->rows in SQLite by implementing 
       a hand-rolled row counter.

Tue  Sep 7  2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Fixed a bug in the "Select new location for DB file" dialog in
       Preferences.
     * Moved the get_homedir code to a subroutine.
     * Bumped version to 2.0pre1

Mon  Sep 6  2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Happy birthday to me!
     * Added support for AAC files (.m4a, .mp4) via the MP4::Info module.
       Protected AAC (iTunes Music Store, .m4p) don't work.

Sun  Sep 5  2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Switch the updater to use SQLite transactions on the inserts, instead
       of autocommits.  Makes things much faster.

Fri  Sep 3  2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Give up on having the 2.0 updater in Perl/Tk and get it working
       via the console.
     * Begin documentation update for 2.0.

Wed  May 26 2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)

     * Move database schema into the __DATA__ block of mrvoice.pl

Tue  May 25 2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Display invalid songs (where there is an entry in the database, but
       no corresponding file on disk) in the search results, but tag them
       in red.

Mon  Apr 26 2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Switched direct accesses of @_ to use shift() instead.  Seems more
       perlish and easier to read.

Sun  Apr 25 2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Tightened up some Fkey code - I had way too many repeated lines
       in there.

Fri  Apr 23 2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Mr. Voice now compiles under "use strict" - I rock.

     * Bumped version number to 1.10.7
     * Got rid of a lot of repeated code in the hotkeys area.  More

     * Removed obsolete $bulkaddtypes definition.

Sun  Apr 11 2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Changed the DropSite behavior to use a DropSite for each part of
       the hotkey area (Frame, Checkbutton, and Label) - needed in 
       804.026-final.
     * Bumped version number to 1.10.4 in preparation for bugfix release.

Thu  Mar 25 2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)

       a search.
     * Released Mr. Voice version 1.10.2

Thu  Mar 18 2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Released Mr. Voice version 1.10

Wed  Mar 17 2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Add an ugly hack to work around brokenness in getOpenFile and
       getSaveFile with the -initialdir option under Win32.

Fri  Mar 12 2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Send STDERR and STDOUT to a file by default, since Win32 builds
       use the --gui flag and thus have no console for output any more.

Thu  Mar 11 2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Move the check for orphaned files into the main codebase, under
       the Advanced Search menu.

Wed  Mar 10 2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Fixed "y3k" bug in the Advanced Search, where you couldn't select
       a year greater than 2003, thanks to hardcoded values.  Oops.
     * Fixed some scoping issues in a quest to "use strict".

Tue  Mar  9 2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Win32 path cleanups for the dump_database and import_database
       functions.

Mon  Mar  8 2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Win32 path fix for bulk_add function, that prevented the addition
       of files with spaces in the path names.

Fri  Mar  5 2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Rework the 1.10 database update to be a little nicer, including
       giving the user a chance to back up their database.

Thu  Mar  4 2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Give the main or Tank listboxes focus() when they're clicked on. 
       Allows for keyboard navigation.
     * Use Time::HiRes for reporting search times - sub-second accuracy.
     * Reimplement the build_category_menubutton to make proper use of
       variable references in the -variable option.  Failure to do so 
       broke the whole system.

Tue  Mar  2 2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * More switching to fetchrow_hashref to improve readability.
     * Consolidate a bunch of repeated category menubutton code into
       one function.

Sun  Feb 29 2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Lots of minor cleanup while working on the TPJ article.
     * Switched the XPM of the sound icon over to a GIF for a space 
       savings.

Fri  Feb 27 2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Switching the BrowseEntry search fields back to plain Entry widgets - 
       the embedded xbm was causing problems with PAR, and I don't think 
       anyone used the dropdown functionality anyway.

Wed  Feb 25 2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Module cleanup - PAR/Win32 needs the inclusion of Encode::Unicode,
       but doesn't need all of the explicit module calls that Perl2EXE
       needed.

Tue  Feb 24 2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Consolidate various get_ functions into one - much simpler that way.
     * Refactor some simple database select statements to use 
       selectrow_hashref instead of the whole prepare/execute/finish loop.

Mon  Feb 23 2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Must raise/deiconify the window on Win32 before popping up the
       database update Dialog, for some reason.

Tue  Jan 13 2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Ran the whole code through perltidy.  Funny how it looks a lot
       nicer now...

Wed  Jan  7 2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Add a check to make sure that the publisher update worked, in case
       of problems.

Fri  Jan  2 2004	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * On second thought, maybe we don't need the integrated HTML viewer.

Wed  Dec 31 2003	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Implemented a database column for the publisher of songs.  You can
       restrict searches based on the publisher.  Requested by ComedySportz
       Inc.
     * Moved from Tk::DirSelect to chooseDirectory (new in 804.xxx).  This
       had the added side effect of removing a directory select bug on
       first run.

Tue  Dec 30 2003	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Use Cwd 'abs_path' to find the root of the docs tree.
     * Allow the ability to save and load a holding tank, like you can
       do with hotkeys.

Mon  Dec 29 2003	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * You can launch a m3u playlist from the contents of the Holding 
       Tank now.  Suggested by Bill C. in Portland.
     * Added a simple HTML documentation viewer based on Tk::Web.  Dunno
       if it works on Windows, though.

Mon  Dec 15 2003	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Fixed a typo in a variable name.

Sat  Dec  6 2003	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Allow drags to the Hotkeys from either the mainbox or Holding Tank.

Wed  Nov 26 2003	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Switch the edit/delete category functions from RadioButtons 
       to a Listbox.  This will make the dialog box nicer when there
       are several entries.

Tue  Nov 25 2003	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Allow MultiDrop into the Holding Tank.

Thu  Nov  6 2003	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Tagged 1.9.2, a bugfix release for the drag-and-drop problem.

Tue  Nov  4 2003	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Override the default behavior of the extended select mode for
       Tk::Listbox, to fix a problem where drag-and-drop selected too
       much stuff.

Mon  Oct 20 2003	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Switched the File::Spec stuff from OO style to functional style,
       since nothing else in this software is OO.

Fri  Oct 10 2003	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Finally fixed a spurious warning when playing files.

       songs.

Fri  Aug  1 2003	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Switch from using $$ variables to a %config hash to store
       configuration values.

Mon  Jul 28 2003        H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * The Holding Tank will now retain its entries when it's closed and
       reopened.
     * The Holding Tank now has its own accelerator hotkey, Ctrl-T

Fri  Jul 25 2003	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * MUCH cleaner code for the up/down in the tankbox, courtesy
       of "Mastering Perl/Tk"

       cases.

       selections.

       Suggested by Steve L. in Greensboro.

Fri  Jul 11 2003	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * New logo, courtesy of Photoshop.  ;-)

     * Fixed weird spacing issues with the ProgressBar.

Mon  Apr 29 2003        H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Use a Tk::ProgressBar in the update_times subroutine.
     * Display the full category name, not the code, in the search window
       and the bulk-add window.

Tue  Apr 15 2003        H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Use the directory selector for the MP3/Hotkey directory preferences.

     * Fixed minor coding errors.

Sat  Mar 29 2003        H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Reworked the Ogg Vorbis infrastructure to use the PurePerl module. 
       This module should work on all platforms.

Thu  Mar 27 2003	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Rewrote the hotkey subsystem to be a little more robust.

Fri  Jan  3 2003	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)

Thu  Dec 12 2002	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Removed the "Are you sure you want to show the whole database" 
       popup box, as searches of the whole database now take under a second.
     * Tagged Version 1.7

Wed  Dec 11 2002	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Use a progress bar to show the status of the initial time
       conversion.

Tue  Dec 10 2002	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Put in code to check if the database is at 1.7 levels, and if
       it's not, convert the database.

Tue  Dec  3 2002	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Store the song length time in the database now.  This speeds
       up searches to an absurd rate.

Wed  Nov 13 2002	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Removed the "Assign Hotkey" button from the bottom of the main
       window.  Apparently nobody was using it anyway.
     * Relocated the Stop button to the bottom-right corner.

     * Other minor cosmetic fixes.

Wed  Nov  6 2002	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Made a change so that when you load hotkeys, the hotkey
       box will display.  Bugzilla ID #10

Sat  Nov  2 2002        H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Fixed a bug I introduced that would lead to the $filepath
       variable getting overwritten.

Fri  Nov  1 2002	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Auto-populate on Oggs, too.

       leave you in the directory you want.

Fri  Aug 30 2002	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Made "Ok" the default button in the Edit Song dialog, instead

Wed  Aug 13 2002	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Tagged Version 1.6.
     * Updated the documentation for 1.6.

Tue  Aug 12 2002	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Gave up on using WM_COMMAND to communicate with WinAmp via the
       Windows API.  Too gimpy.  Instead, I'm going with the WinAmp
       httpQ plugin (http://www.csc.uvic.ca/~karvanit/) to do advanced
       things like fade-stop.
     * Bumped the version number to 1.5.5.

Mon  Aug 11 2002	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)

       the playing time of Vorbis files.

Mon  Jul 15 2002	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Added a feature so that if you get an error while adding a new
       song, you can start over with the already-supplied information
       filled in.  Suggested by Bill C. in Portland.

Tue  Jul  9 2002	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Fixed it so that Ctrl-P will play the currently-selected song in
       the holding tank, if the holding tank window is the active one.
       Suggested by Bill C. in Portland.

Sun  Jul  7 2002	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Big update from my Long Island trip. 
     * Fixed a bug that was preventing date-based searching from working
       under Windows.
     * Added hooks into WinAmp for stopping MP3s.  Also, shift-clicking
       on the stop button, or shift-escape, will activate WinAmp's
       "fade out to stop" function.  (Suggested by Randy in KC)

Tue  Jul  2 2002	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Added (finally) the code to edit a category's description.

Fri  Jun 28 2002	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)

       term, and delete them if found.

Mon  Jun 24 2002	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Fixed the dynamic documents menu so that, if a file is already in
       the list, it just moves it to the front of the line, rather
       than adding it twice.

Fri  Jun 14 2002	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Got the arbitrary-date searching working well enough.
     * Incorporated a Tk::Wm patch from c.l.p.tk to compensate for

     * Added an elapsed-time counter for searches.
     * Significant work on arbitrary-date searches.
     * Carolina is eliminated in the Stanley Cup finals 4 to 1.  A 
       disappointing end, but it was an incredible season and a great run
       through the finals.  Go Canes!

Fri  May 24 2002	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Putting the framework in place for advanced, date-based searches.

Thu  May 23 2002        H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)

       would result in the entire database getting displayed.  Thanks to
       Randy in KC for the idea.

Thu  May  9 2002	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org) 
     * Added Scrollwheel mouse support in the scrolled listboxes.  Thanks
       to Bling-Bling in Raleigh for the idea.

     * Released version 1.5

Thu  May  2 2002	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Added some hardcoded "use" lines at the top of the script.  This
       is required by perl2exe, which I am investigating using for
       the Windows builds.
     * Added code to check for a file named "default.mrv" in the hotkey
       save directory.  If that exists, load up those hotkeys when
       the program starts.  Suggested by Randy at CSZ-KC.
     * Fixed a bug where the "Number of items returned" count wouldn't
       decrement when an MP3 is unavailable/unreadable.

       required fields.
     * Switched the documentation screenshots from .jpg/.eps (which

       PDF and HTML.

Wed  Feb  6 2002	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Took a first stab at adding an icon for the program.  Maybe one

Tue  Feb  5 2002	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)

Sun  Jan 27 2002	H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Changed code so that it does file types other than MP3.

       are justified.
     * Added a busy/unbusy call to the search function, so that the cursor
       changes to a watch while the search is in progress.

Mon  Nov 12 2001        H. Wade Minter (minter@lunenburg.org)
     * Using Win32::Process to start/stop the MP3 player on Windows.  A much
