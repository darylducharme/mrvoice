All of the documentation for Mr. Voice now lives in the docs/ subdirectory
of this distribution.  Check there for the installation and configuration
guide.

Documentation is currently provided in two forms: a PDF file 
(docs/pdf/mrvoice.pdf), and HTML (the main file is docs/html/book1.htm).

The current documentation can always be found at the Mr. Voice website:

  http://www.lunenburg.org/mrvoice/

If you notice any errors/omissions/etc. with the documentation, feel free
to email me at: minter@lunenburg.org
