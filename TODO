Things I'm currently working on:

* Tabbed interface to the Hotkeys.
* Allow users to specify the filename in a Bundle export.
* Multi-file upload and download in Mr. Voice Online.
* More predefined searched in Mr. Voice Online.
* Use Smart::Comments for debugging.
* Add menu options for copying songs to the holding tank.
* Check whether or not the MP3 player is running before playing.
* Rework table structure to use a "join table" between songs and categories,
  thus allowing songs to live in multiple categories.
* General code cleanup and pretty-fication.
