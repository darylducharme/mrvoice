Things I'm currently working on:

* A better way to recover from errors in the Add Song section
* Display database-based information in the Hotkeys listing, instead of
  just the MP3 filename.
* Drag-And-Drop between the Hotkeys listing and the Holding Tank.
* Reporting tools within the GUI
* General cleanup and pretty-fication.
