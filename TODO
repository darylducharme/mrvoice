Things I'm currently working on:

* Debug mode - log stuff to a file with the proper switch.
* Save/load holding tank.
* Fix DirSelect problem on first run.
* Switch some edit listings from RadioButton to ListBox.
* Drag-And-Drop between the Hotkeys listing and the Holding Tank.
* General cleanup and pretty-fication.
