If you're upgrading from version 0.9 or earlier, the functionality from
the PHP frontends has been folded into the program itself, so the
mrvoice.php, index.php, config.php, categories.php and mrvoice-add.php files
are deprecated.  The mrvoice.php file included now is just a frontend to
search the database.
