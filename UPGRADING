If you're upgrading from version 0.9 or earlier, the functionality from
the PHP frontends has been folded into the program itself, so the
mrvoice.php, index.php, config.php, categories.php and mrvoice-add.php files
are deprecated.  The mrvoice.php file included now is just a frontend to
search the database.  

If you're upgrading from version 8.1.1 or earlier, there is a new module
required.  You'll need to install Tk::FileDialog from:

http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Tk/

This replaces the native Tk::FileSelect module that had some problems
under Linux.
