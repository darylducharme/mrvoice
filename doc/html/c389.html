>Now that you have Mr. Voice and other required software set up and configured, it's time to actually use it.  First you have to populate the database with songs.  Then you can do useful things with them.  Look at the following screenshot of the main Mr. Voice window to familiarize yourself with the layout.

>3.1.1. Categories</A
></H2
><P
>Category options are very simple.  You can either add a category, edit its long (descriptive) name, or delete a category.  All options can be found under the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Categories</SPAN

><P
>To add a new category, choose <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Categories</SPAN
>-&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Add Category</SPAN

></DIV

>
      The Category Code is a short (4-5 letters max.) identifier for the category, whereas the Category Description is the longer name that you'll normally see.  However, make the Category Code something useful, because it will be displayed next to the Choose Category button on the main window.  For example, if you want a category called "Joe's Fly Tunes", you could use "JOE" for the Category Code and "Joe's Fly Tunes" for the category description.  </P
><P
>To delete a category, choose <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"

>Songs are the audio data that you're trying to play.  You can use any sort of audio data that your audio player can handle, but Mr. Voice can figure out things like playing time for MP3, WAV, Ogg Vorbis, AAC, and WMA files.  If you're not trying to store, categorize, and play audio data, then you're probably using the wrong program!  This manual will refer to the audio data that you are storing as "songs", even though they can, of course, be any kind of audio.  To manipulate songs in the database, there are three main actions: adding songs, deleting songs, and editing songs.</P
><P
>To insert a new song into the database, choose <SPAN

So if the category is "Game", the Extra Info is the name of the game.  If the category is for Player Intros, the Extra Info will tell us whether it's specifically for a referee, dimwit, or whatnot.  So, basically it's just free-form for whatever you need, and is an <SPAN

Select the category, and a directory that contains the set of MP3, OGG, AAC, or WMA files that you would like to add to that category.  Mr. Voice will then use the title and artist tags stored in the files to automatically add those files into your selected category.  If you need to add Extra Info or modify any other fields, you will need to do that after the fact, but this should be a good way to add lots of data at once.  You can also specify a publisher here, useful when adding a whole CD's worth of songs with the same publisher.</P
><P
>There are two other ways to add songs.  The first is that you can select song files on your desktop or file explorer, and drop them onto the main search box of Mr. Voice.  When you do that, the Add New Song function will be launched on those files.  Finally, you can choose the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Songs</SPAN
>-&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Add Songs From Bundle</SPAN

><P
>To delete a song, you must have at least one displayed and selected in the main search results box.  Searching is covered later, but if you hit the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"

>In previous versions of Mr. Voice, a separate program named <TT

CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
