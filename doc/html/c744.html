>4.1. What Is Mr. Voice Online?</A
></H1
><P
>Mr. Voice Online is an attempt to improve the selection of audio available for improv shows, as well as to build a community among people running sound for improv clubs.  The first attempt at Mr. Voice Online was a small subsection of the Mr. Voice website, where people could upload or download files.  It suffered from lack of use.  My theory was that it may be cumbersome to lug files around, have to re-enter the song information, and upload songs through a website.</P
><P
>Starting with Mr. Voice 2.1, I've integrated the online functionality into the Mr. Voice application itself.  If you have an internet connection on your Mr. Voice system, you can now upload, download, and search songs in the online database directly from Mr. Voice itself.  We shall see if this proves easier to use.</P
><P
>To get started with Mr. Voice online, you will need a key.  I am not intending this project to turn into a large-scale filesharing community, so I am restricting use to people involved in improv clubs or other legitimate environments.  Getting a key, if you meet those conditions, is simple.  Fill out the New Key request form at <A
HREF="http://www.mrvoice.net/online/getkey/"
TARGET="_top"
>the Mr. Voice website</A
> (or send an email to minter@mrvoice.net) with your name, the name of your group, and your website.  I'll send you back a key string that looks something like "ac78fe9d-9210-46db-bd40-1b0e27997ead".  Put that string in the Online Options section of your Preferences, check the "Enable online functionality" button, and you're set.  New in 2.2, there is an extra option in that Preference window that lets you change the Mr. Voice Online URL, in case I change it again on my end (like happened between 2.1 and 2.2).</P
