><P
>Mr. Voice was written with a very specific purpose in mind - to be the GUI frontend for an MP3 database I designed for the ComedyWorx Improv comedy group (formerly the Great American Comedy Company, formerly ComedySportz) in Raleigh, NC.</P
><P
>The Voices there over the ten years prior to my joining the club had worked out a very nice system of tapes and CDs that they used during ComedySportz shows.  However, I ran into some issues: It was hard to have a variety of music available at a moment's notice, and there were problems with tapes not getting rewound.  Being a computer geek, I wanted to use MP3s, but I couldn't find anything on the net written with my kind of situation in mind.  So, armed with some books and Red Hat Linux 6.2 on my laptop, I got to work in the winter of 2000.</P
><P
>Because I wrote Mr. Voice in Perl/TK, it had the ability to go cross-platform, even though I was writing it for Linux.  That led to me getting my first work on the Windows version of Perl.</P
><P
>Eventually, something useful began to take shape, and I put the first versions into production at ComedyWorx in early 2001.  And it seems to, by and large, be working pretty well.</P
><P
>And so it goes.  Because this was written for such a specific purpose, I have my doubts whether anyone else will find it useful.  But it's out there, and if you're taking the time to read this, I hope you'll get something out of it!</P
