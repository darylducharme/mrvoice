CLASS="KEYCAP"
>F1</B
> through <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>F12</B
>.  You can bind a song to more than one hotkey if you choose.  To assign a song to a hotkey, open the Show Hotkeys window, left-click on a song within the Search Results box, and drag it over to the name of a hotkey (<B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>F1</B
> through <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>F12</B
>), and drop it on the name.  The song you dragged will then be assigned to the hotkey that you dropped it on.</P
><P
>You can also drags songs from the Holding Tank onto a hotkey, just like you can from the main search box.</P
><P
>To see which hotkeys you currently have defined, choose <SPAN

Note that the Restore Hotkeys feature currently only works for the Clear All Hotkeys and Open Hotkey File (discussed below) options.</P

New in Mr. Voice 1.10, you can save and load the contents of Holding Tanks to a file, just like hotkeys.  Find those options under the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>File</SPAN

><P
>You can then transfer that .zip file to another system, and import it into that installation of Mr. Voice.  The songs will be copied into its database, with the song information from the original.</P
