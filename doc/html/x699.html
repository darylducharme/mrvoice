> through <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>F12</B
>.  You can bind a song to more than one hotkey if you choose.  To assign a song to a hotkey, open the Show Hotkeys window, left-click on a song within the Search Results box, and drag it over to the name of a hotkey (<B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>F1</B
> through <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>F12</B
>), and drop it on the name.  The song you dragged will then be assigned to the hotkey that you dropped it on.</P
><P
>You can also drags songs from the Holding Tank onto a hotkey, just like you can from the main search box.</P

Unlike the Hotkeys window, though, you can have an unlimited number of songs in there at any time, but you can't get one-button access to playing those songs.  New in Mr. Voice 1.10, you can save and load the contents of Holding Tanks to a file, just like hotkeys.  Find those options under the <B
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>File</B
> menu.  You can also export the contents of the Holding Tank as a "bundle" - a special zip file that can be imported in another copy of Mr. Voice, while retaining all the information about the songs.

>You can then transfer that .zip file to another system, and import it into that installation of Mr. Voice.  The songs will be copied into its database, with the song information from the original.</P
