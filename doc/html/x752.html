You can search for text in any field (title, artist, extra info), or narrow your search down by category or by the person who uploaded the song (in case you have a particular person's contributions you want to browse).  There are also currently a couple of options in the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Predefined Searches</SPAN
> menu.  You can show all songs on Mr. Voice Online that do not exist on your system (useful for finding things to download), or you can search all songs on your system that do not exist on Mr. Voice Online (useful for uploading).</P

>Play Now</SPAN
> in the normal Mr. Voice window is now blue and reads <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Download/Add</SPAN
>.  Double-clicking a song in the Mr. Voice Online window, or clicking the <SPAN

>Download/Add</SPAN

><P
>Once the song is downloaded, the standard Add New Song window will be displayed, loaded up with information about the downloaded song.  You can preview the song here, to see if you want it.  If you click <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Ok</SPAN
> (be sure to select a category), the song will be added to your local system.  If you click <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"

><P
>Choosing that menu item will immediately attempt to upload the song to Mr. Voice online.  It will check to be sure that file does not already exist, then start the upload (which could take a while, depending on the size of the file and the speed of your internet connection).  Once the file is uploaded, the status bar will update with the new online song ID of the song, plus the time it took to upload.</P
