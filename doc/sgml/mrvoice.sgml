  <para>This program was written with a very specific purpose in mind - to be the GUI frontend for an MP3 database I designed for the ComedyWorx Improv comedy group (formerly the Great American Comedy Company, formerly ComedySportz) in Raleigh, NC.  As such, it may not be much use for anyone else, but I figured I'd put it out there in case anyone wanted it.</para>
