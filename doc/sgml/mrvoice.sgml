  <title>Foreword</title>
  <para>Mr. Voice was written with a very specific purpose in mind - to be the GUI frontend for an MP3 database I designed for the ComedyWorx Improv comedy group (formerly the Great American Comedy Company, formerly ComedySportz) in Raleigh, NC.</para>
  <para>The Voices there over the ten years prior to my joining the club had worked out a very nice system of tapes and CDs that they used during ComedySportz shows.  However, I ran into some issues: It was hard to have a variety of music available at a moment's notice, and there were problems with tapes not getting rewound.  Being a computer geek, I wanted to use MP3s, but I couldn't find anything on the net written with my kind of situation in mind.  So, armed with some books and Red Hat Linux 6.2 on my laptop, I got to work in the winter of 2000.</para>
  <para>Because I wrote Mr. Voice in Perl/TK, it had the ability to go cross-platform, even though I was writing it for Linux.  That led to me getting my first work on the Windows version of Perl.</para>
  <para>Eventually, something useful began to take shape, and I put the first versions into production at ComedyWorx in early 2001.  And it seems to, by and large, be working pretty well.</para>
  <para>And so it goes.  Because this was written for such a specific purpose, I have my doubts whether anyone else will find it useful.  But it's out there, and if you're taking the time to read this, I hope you'll get something out of it!</para>

  <title>What's New</title>
  <para>A quick reference to what's changed between versions.</para>
  <sect1><title>What's new in Version 1.8</title>
    <para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>There is a <menuchoice> <guimenu>File</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Bulk-Add</guimenuitem> </menuchoice> menu option.  This will allow you to choose a category and a directory full of MP3 or OGG files, and then add all of those files into the specified category, using the ID3 tags to automatically fill in the title and artist.  (Bugzilla ID #8)</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>The hotkey listing now shows title and artist, instead of the raw filename.  Note - changing this caused a change in the format of the hotkey files, so you will need to run the <filename>converthotkeys.pl</filename> utility from the tools subdirectory once before you can use hotkeys under 1.8.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>A bug that affected the F10 hotkey under Windows has been fixed - that key should work like the other hotkeys now.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Better support for Ogg Vorbis files under Windows.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Verified that Mr. Voice runs under MacOS X 10.2 with Perl 5.8 and X11.app.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1><title>What's new in Version 1.7</title>
    <para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>The length of a song is now stored in the database, to greatly speed up search times.  If you edit or replace the raw MP3/OGG/WAV file without deleting and re-adding the song, you will need to run the Update Song Times function from the Songs menu.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>With that change, the database structure has also changed.  The first time you run version 1.7, Mr. Voice will detect the change and update your database automatically.  This should only happen once.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Added support for Winamp/XMMS playlist files (files with .pls or .m3u suffixes)</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Added a "preview song" feature to the Add New Song window</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>If the file you select in the Add New Song window has valid ID3/OGG information on title and artist, those fields will be filled in automatically (So select your file before entering the title and artist)</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Added Alt-key accelerators for the main menu items (ie. <keycombo action='simul'> <keycap>Alt</keycap> <keycap>F</keycap> </keycombo> will get you the File menu)</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>The first result returned by a search is now active, so you can press <keycombo action='simul'> <keycap>Control</keycap> <keycap>P</keycap> </keycombo> to start playing quickly.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>When you open a saved hotkey file, the Hotkeys window will display automatically.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Added Dump/Restore Database options to the File menu.  You can use these to take backups of your database, or to import a prior backup.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Drag-And-Drop now displays an icon instead of the song name, to band-aid over a problem with the incorrect song name being displayed.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Removed the "Are you sure you want to display the whole database?" popup search box, as those searches seem to take under a second now.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1><title>What's new in Version 1.6</title>
    <para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>Added a timer to show you how long database searches take.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Added advanced searching functions under the "Advanced Search" menu, allowing you to quickly see what songs have changed in a particular timespan.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Fixed a bug in the dynamic documents list, so that the same document won't show up twice in the list.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Strip leading and trailing whitespace from search terms, so that searches won't fail if you accidentally search for "Beatles " instead of "Beatles".</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Added an "Edit Category" function, so you can edit the long, descriptive name of a category</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><keycombo action='simul'> <keycap>Control</keycap> <keycap>P</keycap> </keycombo> will now play the song selected in the Holding Tank, if the Holding Tank is the active window.  (Suggested by Bill C. in Portland)</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>The Add Song box will now, if it finds an error, keep the stuff you've already entered and let you fix the error, rather than making you start over completely.  (Suggested by Bill C. in Portland)</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Added better handling for displaying the playing time of <ulink url="http://www.vorbis.com/">Ogg Vorbis</ulink> files under Linux.  Windows/ActivePerl doesn't have the Ogg::Vorbis module yet, so it's currently Linux-only.</para></listitem> 
        <listitem><para>Added the option to use the <ulink url="http://www.csc.uvic.ca/~karvanit/">httpQ</ulink> WinAmp plugin.  If you install and configure the plugin (see Windows installation section), you can shift-click on the <guibutton>Stop</guibutton> button, or press <keycombo action='simul'> <keycap>Shift</keycap> <keycap>Escape</keycap> </keycombo>, and the currently-playing song will fade out and stop over a couple of seconds, instead of stopping abruptly.  <emphasis>This is a Windows/WinAmp-only feature.</emphasis>  (Suggested by Randy in KC)</para></listitem>

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
