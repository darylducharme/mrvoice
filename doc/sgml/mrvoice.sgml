  <title>Foreword</title>
  <para>This program was written with a very specific purpose in mind - to be the GUI frontend for an MP3 database I designed for the ComedyWorx Improv comedy group (formerly the Great American Comedy Company, formerly ComedySportz) in Raleigh, NC.  As such, it may not be much use for anyone else, but I figured I'd put it out there in case anyone wanted it.</para>

<appendix><title>Known Bugs and Issues</title>
  <para>The following items are known as bugs that need to be fixed and/or enhancements that should be made:
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>Hotkeys will not work unless the main Mr. Voice window is selected and active.  The desired behavior is that hotkeys will work if <emphasis>any</emphasis> Mr. Voice window is selected</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>The "last files accessed" menu should be smarter about recognizing if files that are already on the list are being accessed.  Right now, it'll just add another listing for the same file on the bottom of the list.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>There is no equivalent of the Unix <filename>~/.mrvoicerc</filename> file for Windows use.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>The file-selector box for Unix ignores the <varname>$savedir</varname> variable, putting you in / instead.  This is a bug with Perl/Tk and will be fixed in Tk800.024.</para></listitem>
