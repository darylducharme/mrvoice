  <title>Foreword</title>
  <para>Mr. Voice was written with a very specific purpose in mind - to be the GUI frontend for an MP3 database I designed for the ComedyWorx Improv comedy group (formerly the Great American Comedy Company, formerly ComedySportz) in Raleigh, NC.</para>
  <para>The Voices there over the ten years prior to my joining the club had worked out a very nice system of tapes and CDs that they used during ComedySportz shows.  However, I ran into some issues: It was hard to have a variety of music available at a moment's notice, and there were problems with tapes not getting rewound.  Being a computer geek, I wanted to use MP3s, but I couldn't find anything on the net written with my kind of situation in mind.  So, armed with some books and Red Hat Linux 6.2 on my laptop, I got to work in the winter of 2000.</para>
  <para>Because I wrote Mr. Voice in Perl/TK, it had the ability to go cross-platform, even though I was writing it for Linux.  That led to me getting my first work on the Windows version of Perl.</para>
  <para>Eventually, something useful began to take shape, and I put the first versions into production at ComedyWorx in early 2001.  And it seems to, by and large, be working pretty well.</para>
  <para>And so it goes.  Because this was written for such a specific purpose, I have my doubts whether anyone else will find it useful.  But it's out there, and if you're taking the time to read this, I hope you'll get something out of it!</para>

  <title>What's New</title>
  <para>A quick reference to what's changed between versions.</para>
  <sect1><title>What's new in Version 2.1.1?</title>
    <para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>Fixed a bug where attempting to use the online version check when your internet connection was down would cause Mr. Voice to fail to start.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Fixed a long-standing bug where searching for a string with an apostrophe in it would cause an error.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Fixed a bug where adding a new song file with no ID3 information would blank out title and artist that you put in.  Now the manual title and artist are only overwritten when there is valid ID3 data in the file.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1><title>What's new in Version 2.1?</title>
    <para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>First attempt at an integrated Mr. Voice Online system, with an XML-RPC backend.  See the Mr. Voice Online section in the manual for details.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Add "bundles" - a way to put songs into the holding tank, then export them in a .zip file that can then be imported into someone else's Mr. Voice, keeping intact all information about the song.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Add an option to perform an online check to see if a new version of Mr. Voice is available, once a week.  Controlled in the Preferences menu, and you need an internet connection (of course) for it to work.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Add a feature where if Windows or Linux users drag-and-drop a song file (or files) from the desktop onto the main search box, the add-new-song feature will be launched on those files.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Add the ability, through an option in the Preferences, to password-protect functions in Mr. Voice that would modify the database.  Useful if you have people running sound who might have . . . descructive tendancies.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Several changes to make MacOS X more usable.  The OS X release is packaged in an experimental "application bundle" much like "real" OS X applications.  It also uses the free Audion audio player, instead of XMMS under X11.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>New hotkey menu item to clear the Holding Tank in one stroke.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Minor database schema update (tracking MD5 checksums for song files in the database).  The application should update your database automatically.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Improve debug logging</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>New Mr. Voice logo and website.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1><title>What's new in Version 2.0?</title>
    <para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The MySQL database has been eliminated.  Mr. Voice now runs an embedded database, SQLite.  This means that you do not need to install, run, or configure MySQL in order to use Mr. Voice from the 2.0 release forward.</para>
          <para>Why the change?  Several reasons.
            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem><para><emphasis>Complexity</emphasis>: Mr. Voice uses a very simple database backend - only two tables, and no complex queries.  Running an entire relational database engine to manage those two tables was overkill, bbut it was the best solution I had when I started the project.  SQLite looks like a much simpler solution, while still being able to do what the software needs.</para></listitem>
              <listitem><para><emphasis>Ease of Installation</emphasis>: Over the years, MySQL was the biggest cause of problems for users.  Getting the database installed, the processes running, and the usernames and passwords straight were indeed a pain.  SQLite has one configuration option - the path to a single file.  That's it.</para></listitem>
              <listitem><para><emphasis>Resources</emphasis>: MySQL was a fairly heavyweight installation - several gigs of disk space, as well as needing to run an extra process to handle the database.  On older or smaller systems, that could be a strain.  SQLite doesn't need any extra processes running, and on my 1300-song database, it takes up 125Kb of disk space.</para></listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
          </para> 
          <para>From my observation, it looks like SQLite will be a solid, reliable database engine.  I certainly welcome feedback from users as to how well it works for them.</para>
          <para>See Section 1.2.1 ("Upgrading to Mr. Voice 2.0") for details on how to upgrade a Mr. Voice 0.x or 1.x (MySQL) installation to a Mr. Voice 2.x (SQLite) setup.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem><para>There are two options that you can pass to the Mr. Voice executable.  <computeroutput>--config CONFIGFILENAME</computeroutput> allows you to specify an alternate configuration file, useful if you can't write to the C: drive in Windows or if you want to run two different databases off of the same Mr. Voice installation.  <computeroutput>--logfile</computeroutput> allows you to specify a logfile that will capture information generated by the Mr. Voice executable, which can be useful for debugging.  You can specify a logfile name or, if you just do <computeroutput>--logfile</computeroutput>, it will be sent to <filename>C:\MRVOICE.LOG</filename> or <filename>~/mrvoice.log</filename>.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>"Invalid" songs (songs where there is an entry in the database, but no corresponding file on disk) now show up in red in the search box, instead of being hidden.  This should solve problems where you were unable to delete a category because there were still songs in it, but a search of the category revealed nothing.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>AAC (Advanced Audio Codec) files, also known as .mp4 or .m4a files, are now supported (playing them requires the proper plugin for your audio player of choice).  Encrypted songs purchased from the iTunes Music Store (.m4p) apparently do not work.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Mr. Voice itself will offer to perform a default configuration the first time it's run on a new system.  The defaults should be good enough for most people, but you always have the option of doing things manually.  This replaces the old <filename>quicksetup.pl</filename> utility, which has been removed.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>The look-and-feel of the main search box and the holding tank have changed, hopefully for the better.  One visible change is that the song ID number is no longer displayed at the beginning of each line.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Mr. Voice now compiles under "use strict" in Perl.  Ha!  And they said it couldn't be done . . .</para></listitem>
       </itemizedlist>

  <sect1><title>What's new in Version 1.10?</title>
    <para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>You can <keycap>Control</keycap>-click in the main listbox to select multiple files, then drag all of those files at once into the Holding Tank.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>The structure of the Edit/Delete Category boxes has changed to make them fit on the screen a bit better.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>You can drag songs from either the main listbox or the Holding Tank onto a hotkey.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Clicking inside a lisbox (such as the main box or the Holding Tank), or performing a search, will allow you to use the up and down arrow keys to move around in that listbox.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>The Holding Tank features a blue Launch Playlist button that will put the contents of the Holding Tank into a Winamp/XMMS playlist and start playing them.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>You can now save and load the contents of the Holding Tank, just like you can with the Hotkeys, from options in the <menuchoice> <guimenu>File</guimenu></menuchoice> menu.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>The former standalone "orphans.pl" script, which searched your file directory for audio files that were no longer referenced by any database entry, has now been included in the main program.  Look for it under <menuchoice> <guimenu>Advanced Search</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Find orphaned files</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>If music licensing is a concern, you can now assign a Publisher to each song in the database, and restrict searches based on allowed publishers.  The options to restrict the searches are in the <menuchoice> <guimenu>File</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem> </menuchoice> menu.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Most category buttons now update to show which category you've selected.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>The "dropdown" feature of the main search fields (Artist, Title, etc.) have been removed.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>MySQL 4.x and Winamp 5.x are now the preferred environments under Windows, replacing MySQL 3.x and Winamp 2.x.</para></listitem>

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
