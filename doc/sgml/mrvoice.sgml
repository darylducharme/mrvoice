  <title>Foreword</title>
  <para>Mr. Voice was written with a very specific purpose in mind - to be the GUI frontend for an MP3 database I designed for the ComedyWorx Improv comedy group (formerly the Great American Comedy Company, formerly ComedySportz) in Raleigh, NC.</para>
  <para>The Voices there over the ten years prior to my joining the club had worked out a very nice system of tapes and CDs that they used during ComedySportz shows.  However, I ran into some issues: It was hard to have a variety of music available at a moment's notice, and there were problems with tapes not getting rewound.  Being a computer geek, I wanted to use MP3s, but I couldn't find anything on the net written with my kind of situation in mind.  So, armed with some books and Red Hat Linux 6.2 on my laptop, I got to work in the winter of 2000.</para>
  <para>Because I wrote Mr. Voice in Perl/TK, it had the ability to go cross-platform, even though I was writing it for Linux.  That led to me getting my first work on the Windows version of Perl.</para>
  <para>Eventually, something useful began to take shape, and I put the first versions into production at ComedyWorx in early 2001.  And it seems to, by and large, be working pretty well.</para>
  <para>And so it goes.  Because this was written for such a specific purpose, I have my doubts whether anyone else will find it useful.  But it's out there, and if you're taking the time to read this, I hope you'll get something out of it!</para>

<appendix><title>Known Bugs and Issues</title>
  <para>The following items are known as bugs that need to be fixed and/or enhancements that should be made:
    <itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>On Windows, if things aren't working right, double-check to make sure that you are using the "\" character to separate the path, and also that you are using the "short-form" for the path to your MP3 player.  The short form means that there can be no spaces in the path name, so <filename>C:\progra~1\winamp\winamp.exe</filename> is good, but <filename>C:\program files\winamp\winamp.exe</filename> is bad.  If you need help, run <command>dir /x</command> to see the short names.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Hotkeys will not work unless the main Mr. Voice window is selected and active.  The desired behavior is that hotkeys will work if <emphasis>any</emphasis> Mr. Voice window is selected</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>The "last files accessed" menu should be smarter about recognizing if files that are already on the list are being accessed.  Right now, it'll just add another listing for the same file on the bottom of the list.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>The file-selector box for Unix ignores the <varname>$savedir</varname> variable, putting you in / instead.  This is a bug with Perl/Tk and will be fixed in Tk800.024.</para></listitem>

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
