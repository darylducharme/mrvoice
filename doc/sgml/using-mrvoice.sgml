<chapter><title>Using Mr. Voice</title>

  <para>Now that you have Mr. Voice and other required software set up and configured, it's time to actually use it.  First you have to populate the database with songs.  Then you can do useful things with them.
  </para>

  <sect1><title>Adding, Deleting, and Editing Songs and Categories</title>
    <para>Mr. Voice lets you set up categories, then put your songs into those categories for later use.  So we'll address the categories first.</para>
    <sect2><title>Categories</title>
      <para>Category options are very simple.  You can either add a category, or delete a category.  Both options can be found under the <menuchoice> <guimenu>Categories</guimenu> </menuchoice> menu on the main display.</para>
      <para>To add a new category, choose <menuchoice> <guimenu>Categories</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Add Category</guimenuitem> </menuchoice>.  You will then have a box pop up where you can enter two items: The <guilabel>Category Code</guilabel> and the <guilabel>Category Description</guilabel>.  <screenshot> <graphic fileref="../images/addcat.jpg" scale="75"> </screenshot> The Category Code is a short (4-5 letters max.) identifier for the category, whereas the Category Description is the longer name that you'll actually see.  For example, if you want a category called "Joe's Fly Tunes", you could use "JOE" for the Category Code and "Joe's Fly Tunes" for the category description.  </para>
      <note>
        <para>After you add the category, you will get a note that you need to restart Mr. Voice before the new categories will be available.  This should hopefully be fixed in later releases.</para>
      </note>
      <para>To delete a category, choose <menuchoice> <guimenu>Categories</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Delete Category</guimenuitem> </menuchoice>.  A box will pop up listing all of your defined categories.  You can choose the button next to the category that you would like to delete, then press <guibutton>Ok</guibutton> to delete the category. <screenshot> <graphic fileref="../images/delcat.jpg" scale="75"> </screenshot> </para>
      <important>
        <para>You cannot delete a category if it still has songs in it.  Delete/edit all songs out of the category before trying to delete it.</para>
      </important>
    </sect2>

    <sect2><title>Songs</title>
      <para>Songs are the MP3 audio data that you're trying to play.  If you're not trying to store, categorize, and play audio data, then you're probably using the wrong program!  This manual will refer to the audio data that you are storing as "songs", even though they can be any kind of audio.  To manipulate songs in the database, there are three main actions: adding songs, deleting songs, and editing songs.</para>
      <para>To insert a new song into the database, choose <menuchoice> <guimenu>Songs</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Add New Song</guimenuitem> </menuchoice>.  A box will pop up for the needed information: <screenshot> <graphic fileref="../images/addsong.jpg" scale="75"> </screenshot></para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para><guilabel>Song Title</guilabel>: This is where you put the title of the song that you are adding.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><guilabel>Artist</guilabel>: The artist responsible for the song.  This is an <emphasis>optional</emphasis> item.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><guilabel>Category</guilabel>:  Pressing the <guilabel>Choose Category</guilabel> button beside this entry will give you a list of the categories that you currently have defined.  You must choose one of these categories to place the song into.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><guilabel>Category Extra Info</guilabel>: Kind of a "hodgepodge" entry, this information can be whatever you want.  At ComedyWorx, we use it as a modifier for the category.  So if the category is "Game", the Extra Info is the name of the game.  If the category is for Player Intros, the Extra Info will tell us whether it's specifically for a referee, dimwit, or whatnot.  So, basically it's just free-form for whatever you need, and is an <emphasis>optional</emphasis> field.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><guilabel>File To Add</guilabel>:  This is where you give Mr. Voice the path to the actual MP3 file that you want to add.  Clicking the <guibutton>Select File</guibutton> button will bring up a basic "file chooser" box.  <screenshot> <graphic fileref="../images/addsong-files.jpg" scale="75"> </screenshot> Use this to go to the location of your file, left-click on the name of the file, then click <guibutton>Ok</guibutton>.  The name of the file should now be listed in the <guilabel>File To Add</guilabel> box.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist> 
      <para>You can now press the <guibutton>Ok</guibutton> button to add the song.  If all goes well, you should see a message that the file was added to the database.  If not, Mr. Voice should tell you what went wrong.</para>
      <note><para>Mr. Voice actually makes a copy of the file that you select, renames it to a standard form, and places the new copy in the location given by the <varname>$filepath</varname> variable that you defined in the setup.  Your original MP3 file is not used after the copy is made.</para></note>
      <para>To delete a song, you must have one displayed and selected in the main search results box.  Searching is covered later, but if you hit the <guibutton>Do Search</guibutton> button, it should show you all of the songs in your database.</para>
      <para>Once you have some songs displayed, left-click once on the name of the song that you want to delete, then choose <menuchoice> <guimenu>Songs</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Delete Currently Selected Song</guimenuitem> </menuchoice>.  A box will pop up asking you to confirm the deletion, and also presenting a checkbox labeled <guilabel>Delete File On Disk</guilabel>.   <screenshot> <graphic fileref="../images/delsong.jpg" scale="75"> </screenshot> If you do not select this, the song will be removed from the database, but the actual MP3 file on disk, located at <varname>$filepath</varname>, will remain.  If you do select this option, the song will be removed from the database AND the MP3 file on disk will be deleted.</para>
      <note><para>If you do not have a song selected in the main display box and choose <menuchoice> <guimenu>Songs</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Delete Currently Selected Song</guimenuitem> </menuchoice> or <menuchoice> <guimenu>Songs</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Edit Currently Selected Song</guimenuitem> </menuchoice>, then nothing will happen.  This is normal.  If you are trying to edit or delete a song and don't get the repective boxes showing up on-screen, make sure that you have a song highlighted.</para></note>
      <para>Finally, if you want to edit a song in the database, left-click a song in the main display window, and choose <menuchoice> <guimenu>Songs</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Edit Currently Selected Song</guimenuitem> </menuchoice>.  A box will pop up that is similar to the one for <menuchoice> <guimenu>Songs</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Add New Song</guimenuitem> </menuchoice>, except without the file selector option.  You can make any needed changes to the song, then press <guibutton>Ok</guibutton> to commit them.</para>
