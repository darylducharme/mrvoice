<chapter><title>Using Mr. Voice</title>

  <para>Now that you have Mr. Voice and other required software set up and configured, it's time to actually use it.  First you have to populate the database with songs.  Then you can do useful things with them.  Look at the following diagram of the main Mr. Voice window for definitions of terms that will be used: 
    <figure>

  </para>

  <sect1><title>Adding, Deleting, and Editing Songs and Categories</title>
    <para>Mr. Voice lets you set up categories, then put your songs into those categories for later use.  So we'll address the categories first.</para>
    <sect2><title>Categories</title>
      <para>Category options are very simple.  You can either add a category, or delete a category.  Both options can be found under the <menuchoice> <guimenu>Categories</guimenu> </menuchoice> menu on the main display.</para>
      <para>To add a new category, choose <menuchoice> <guimenu>Categories</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Add Category</guimenuitem> </menuchoice>.  You will then have a box pop up where you can enter two items: The <guilabel>Category Code</guilabel> and the <guilabel>Category Description</guilabel>.  
        <figure>
	  <title>The Add Category window</title>
	  <mediaobject>
	    <imageobject>
	      <imagedata fileref="../images/addcat.jpg" format="jpg">

	    <textobject>
	      <phrase>Screenshot of the Add Category window</phrase>
	    </textobject>
	  </mediaobject>
	</figure>
      The Category Code is a short (4-5 letters max.) identifier for the category, whereas the Category Description is the longer name that you'll actually see.  For example, if you want a category called "Joe's Fly Tunes", you could use "JOE" for the Category Code and "Joe's Fly Tunes" for the category description.  </para>
      <note>
        <para>After you add the category, you will get a note that you need to restart Mr. Voice before the new categories will be available.  This should hopefully be fixed in later releases.</para>
      </note>
      <para>To delete a category, choose <menuchoice> <guimenu>Categories</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Delete Category</guimenuitem> </menuchoice>.  A box will pop up listing all of your defined categories.  You can choose the button next to the category that you would like to delete, then press <guibutton>Ok</guibutton> to delete the category. 
        <figure>

      <important>
        <para>You cannot delete a category if it still has songs in it.  Delete/edit all songs out of the category before trying to delete it.</para>
      </important>
    </sect2>

    <sect2><title>Songs</title>
      <para>Songs are the MP3 audio data that you're trying to play.  If you're not trying to store, categorize, and play audio data, then you're probably using the wrong program!  This manual will refer to the audio data that you are storing as "songs", even though they can be any kind of audio.  To manipulate songs in the database, there are three main actions: adding songs, deleting songs, and editing songs.</para>
      <para>To insert a new song into the database, choose <menuchoice> <guimenu>Songs</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Add New Song</guimenuitem> </menuchoice>.  A box will pop up for the needed information: 
        <figure>

	</figure></para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para><guilabel>Song Title</guilabel>: This is where you put the title of the song that you are adding.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><guilabel>Artist</guilabel>: The artist responsible for the song.  This is an <emphasis>optional</emphasis> item.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><guilabel>Category</guilabel>:  Pressing the <guilabel>Choose Category</guilabel> button beside this entry will give you a list of the categories that you currently have defined.  You must choose one of these categories to place the song into.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><guilabel>Category Extra Info</guilabel>: Kind of a "hodgepodge" entry, this information can be whatever you want.  At ComedyWorx, we use it as a modifier for the category.  So if the category is "Game", the Extra Info is the name of the game.  If the category is for Player Intros, the Extra Info will tell us whether it's specifically for a referee, dimwit, or whatnot.  So, basically it's just free-form for whatever you need, and is an <emphasis>optional</emphasis> field.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><guilabel>File To Add</guilabel>:  This is where you give Mr. Voice the path to the actual MP3 file that you want to add.  Clicking the <guibutton>Select File</guibutton> button will bring up a familiar "file chooser" box.  
        <figure>

	Use this to go to the location of your file, left-click on the name of the file, then click <guibutton>Open</guibutton>.  The name of the file should now be listed in the <guilabel>File To Add</guilabel> box.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist> 
      <para>You can now press the <guibutton>Ok</guibutton> button to add the song.  If all goes well, you should see a message that the file was added to the database.  If not, Mr. Voice should tell you what went wrong.</para>
      <note><para>Mr. Voice actually makes a copy of the file that you select, renames it to a standard form, and places the new copy in the location given by the <varname>$filepath</varname> variable that you defined in the setup.  Your original MP3 file is not used after the copy is made.</para></note>
      <para>To delete a song, you must have one displayed and selected in the main search results box.  Searching is covered later, but if you hit the <guibutton>Do Search</guibutton> button, it should show you all of the songs in your database.</para>
      <para>Once you have some songs displayed, left-click once on the name of the song that you want to delete, then choose <menuchoice> <guimenu>Songs</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Delete Currently Selected Song</guimenuitem> </menuchoice>.  You can also right-click on the name of the song and choose the <guimenuitem>Delete Song</guimenuitem> option.  A box will pop up asking you to confirm the deletion, and also presenting a checkbox labeled <guilabel>Delete File On Disk</guilabel>.   
        <figure>

      If you do not select this, the song will be removed from the database, but the actual MP3 file on disk, located at <varname>$filepath</varname>, will remain.  If you do select this option, the song will be removed from the database AND the MP3 file on disk will be deleted.</para>
      <note><para>If you do not have a song selected in the main display box and choose <menuchoice> <guimenu>Songs</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Delete Currently Selected Song</guimenuitem> </menuchoice> or <menuchoice> <guimenu>Songs</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Edit Currently Selected Song</guimenuitem> </menuchoice>, then nothing will happen.  This is normal.  If you are trying to edit or delete a song and don't get the repective boxes showing up on-screen, make sure that you have a song highlighted.</para></note>
      <para>Finally, if you want to edit a song in the database, left-click a song in the main display window, and choose <menuchoice> <guimenu>Songs</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Edit Currently Selected Song</guimenuitem> </menuchoice>.  You can also right-click on a song and choose the <guimenuitem>Edit Song</guimenuitem> option.  A box will pop up that is similar to the one for <menuchoice> <guimenu>Songs</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Add New Song</guimenuitem> </menuchoice>, except without the file selector option.  You can make any needed changes to the song, then press <guibutton>Ok</guibutton> to commit them.</para>
      <note><title>Shortcut!</title><para>You can also right-click a song in the main display box to bring up a shortcut menu.  From this menu, you can choose to edit or delete the selected song.</para></note>

  <sect1><title>Searching and Playing Songs</title>
    <para>Now that you've learned how to put songs into the database, it's time to do something with them.  The following section will show you the basics of searching and playing the songs in your database</para>
    <sect2><title>Searching The Database</title>
      <para>The search fields of the main Mr. Voice window contain the items that you can search for.  You can use any combination of the fields to search, with the exception of the <guilabel>OR any field contains</guilabel> field, which overrides everything except the category.  Let's look at the fields in detail:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para><guilabel>Choose Category</guilabel>: This allows you to set the category to search within.  You can either choose a specific category, or the <guimenuitem>Any Category</guimenuitem> option, which will search all defined categories.  The short name of the currently selected category will be displayed beside the menu.
        <tip><para>If you select the dotted line right above the Any Category option, you can detach the Choose Category menu and place it on your desktop so that it is always available.</para></tip>
        </para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><guilabel>Extra info</guilabel>: Text placed in this box will be compared with the "Extra Info" field of each song.  This, like each of the text entry fields, is a case-insensitive substring match, meaning that if you search for "eat", it will match the words "Eat", "Beatles", "EATING", etc.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><guilabel>Artist</guilabel>: Text in this box will be compared with the "Artist" field of the songs.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><guilabel>Title</guilabel>: Text in this box will be compared with the "Title" field of the songs.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><guilabel>Any Field</guilabel>: Text in this box will be compared to the Title, Artist, and Extra Info fields of each song, and return any song that has a match in any of those fields.  So searching the <guilabel>Any Field</guilabel> box for "eat" will return songs by The Beatles, the song titled "Masterpeace Theatre Theme", or one with the extra info of "Featured".  The only thing that the <guilabel>Any Field</guilabel> does <emphasis>NOT</emphasis> search is the Category - you will need to select that manually.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>After you have filled in the information that you would like to search for, you can either press the <keycap>Enter</keycap> key, or press the <guibutton>Do Search</guibutton> button.  The status bar will tell you how many matching entries your search found, and display the results in the Search Results box.</para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2><title>Playing Songs</title>
      <para>At this point, you have added songs to the database, and you have searched for songs.  Now, with some songs listed in the Search Results box, you're ready to play the songs!</para>
      <para>To play a song, you can left-click on the song in the Search Results box (the song should become highlighed when you do this), and press the green <guibutton>Play Now</guibutton> button.  You can also double-click the song in the Search Results box, or right-click the song and choose the <guimenuitem>Play Song</guimenuitem> option.  When you do this, your MP3 player should spring to life, and you should hear the song coming out of the speakers.  Congratulations!  It works!</para>
      <para>To stop the song, you can either press the red <guibutton>Stop Now</guibutton> button, or press the <keycap>Esc</keycap> key on your keyboard.  Play should then stop.</para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2><title>Exiting Mr. Voice</title>
      <para>To exit Mr. Voice, choose <menuchoice> <guimenu>File</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Exit</guimenuitem> </menuchoice>, or press <keycombo action='simul'> <keycap>Control</keycap> <keycap>Button1</keycap> </keycombo>.  Mr. Voice will exit and your MP3 player will close.</para>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1><title>Hotkeys</title>
    <para>Hotkeys are a convenient way of having songs at the ready when you need them.  They can be used for common situations, events where you need a range of songs ready with little notice, and so forth.  You can also save hotkeys to files for later use.</para>
    <sect2><title>Configuring Hotkeys</title>
      <para>To set up a hotkey, you must first search for a song and have it displayed in the main listbox.  Once you have the song that you want to assign, left-click on the song to highlight it.  Then press the <guibutton>Assign Hotkey</guibutton> button.  When you do that, a box will pop up enabling you to bind the song to one or more keys on your keyboard.  
    <figure>
      <title>The Hotkey Assignment window</title>
      <mediaobject>

          <phrase>Screenshot of the Hotkey Assignment window</phrase>
        </textobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure> 
      The available keys are the function keys <keycap>F1</keycap> through <keycap>F12</keycap>.  You can bind a song to more than one hotkey if you choose.  After you select the keys to bind, press the <guibutton>Apply</guibutton> button.  The hotkey box will disappear, and the status line of the main window will read "Hotkey assigned".  You can repeat this as needed, and you can have up to 12 hotkeys assigned at any time.</para>
      <para>In addition, if you have the Show Hotkeys window open, you can left-click on a song within the Search Results box, and drag it over to the name of a hotkey (F1 through F12), and drop it on the name.  The song you dragged will then be assigned to the hotkey that you dropped it on.</para>
      <para>To see which hotkeys you currently have defined, choose <menuchoice> <guimenu>Hotkeys</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Show Hotkeys</guimenuitem> </menuchoice> from the main menu.  You can also press <keycombo action='simul'> <keycap>Control</keycap> <keycap>H</keycap> </keycombo>. That will bring up a menu showing each of the 12 hotkeys, and beside the key name, the filename of the song that is bound to the key.  If you leave this window up, you can see it change as you add or remove hotkeys.</para>

      </mediaobject>
    </figure> 
      <para>To remove hotkeys, you have two choices: Remove keys individually, or remove them all in one fell swoop.  To remove all hotkeys, choose <menuchoice> <guimenu>Hotkeys</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Clear All Hotkeys</guimenuitem> </menuchoice> from the main menubar.  This will do exactly what it implies - reset all hotkeys back to empty.  You can also, from the <menuchoice> <guimenu>Hotkeys</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Show Hotkeys</guimenuitem> </menuchoice> menu, press the buttons beside any key listing, and choose the <guibutton>Clear Selected</guibutton> button to clear out just the keys that you select, while leaving the others alone.</para>
      <para>If you clear all hotkeys, the <menuchoice> <guimenu>Hotkeys</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Restore Hotkeys</guimenuitem> </menuchoice> option becomes available.  It allows you to return your hotkeys to the state they were in immediately prior to the clearing.  This exists in case you accidentally clear hotkeys that you don't mean to.  Note that the Restore Hotkeys feature currently only works for the Clear All Hotkeys and Open Hotkey File (discussed below) options.</para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2><title>Using Hotkeys</title>
      <para>To use hotkeys once you have defined them, simply make sure that a Mr. Voice window is selected, and press the hotkey for the song that you want.  The song should immediately begin playing.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2><title>Saving and Loading Hotkeys</title>
      <para>To make the use of hotkeys more convenient, you can save groups of hotkeys to a file for later retrieval.  To use this feature, first assign songs to hotkeys like you want.  Then, choose <menuchoice> <guimenu>File</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Save Hotkeys To A File</guimenuitem> </menuchoice>, or press <keycombo action='simul'> <keycap>Control</keycap> <keycap>S</keycap> </keycombo>.  A box will pop up where you can select the filename to save the hotkeys under.  The file by default will be saved in the directory that you defined in the <varname>$savedir</varname> variable during configuration. <note><para>There is currently a bug in the Unix version of Perl/Tk that will ignore the <varname>$savedir</varname> variable when it comes to putting you in the default directory.  It will instead put you in /.  This bug should be fixed in Tk800.024.  Until then, you will have to manually move to the directory you want to save in/load from.</para></note>  Simply enter the filename that you want in the box labeled <guilabel>Filename</guilabel>, and press the <guibutton>Save File</guibutton> button.  The filename will have the extension ".mrv" appended to it, and get written to disk.</para>
     <para>To load a saved hotkey file, simply choose <menuchoice> <guimenu>File</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Open Hotkey File</guimenuitem> </menuchoice>, or press <keycombo action='simul'> <keycap>Control</keycap> <keycap>O</keycap> </keycombo>.  The file box will pop up, and you can choose the name of the hotkey file that you want to load.  Choosing the filename and pressing the <guibutton>Open File</guibutton> button will load the hotkeys defined in the file, and will overwrite <emphasis>all</emphasis> hotkeys that you currently have defined.  If you do this and want your old hotkeys back, choose <menuchoice> <guimenu>Hotkeys</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Restore Hotkeys</guimenuitem> </menuchoice>.</para>
      <para>The most recent hotkey files that you have accessed via a save or open will be listed at the bottom of the <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu.  These four filenames can be selected directly off of the <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu for one-click access to recently-used hotkey files.  To adjust the number of files that are displayed, use the <menuchoice> <guimenu>File</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem> </menuchoice> menu.</para>
