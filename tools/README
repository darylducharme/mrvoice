This directory contains small utilities that you might use to get
the most out of Mr. Voice.  A description of each utility follows.

###### orphans.pl ######
Run this script and it will print out a list of "orphaned" MP3s in your
MP3 storage directory.  And orphaned MP3 is defined as an MP3 file that
is not referenced by any entry in the database.  

If you run "orphans.pl" by itself, it will just print out a report.  If
you run "orphans.pl -d", it will delete the orphaned files.  Adding a
"-v" flag to either of those options will cause the script to become
more verbose in its output, to possibly help you track down any problems.
